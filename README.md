Hi my name is Arghadip Som, so this project will be about implementing all the knowledge that I have gained in HTML till now
and i will be creating a website using those knowledge.

After I finish building my project, I will end up making my base concepts stronger for HTML and at the same time gain more knowledge about it...




Self-Notes( To see my progress :) because I end up procrastinating -_-):
 Ok so I did end up finishing my smallest of the smallest project today itself, which is amazing, it was very easy and importantly I enjoyed the process while making it :).
