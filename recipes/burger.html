 <h2>Description</h2>

 <p>Chicken burgers are notoriously dry, but not anymore! Adding minced roasted mushrooms to ground chicken<br> not only adds extra moisture, it gives a deep umami flavor that even beef lovers will drool over.<br> A little more time-intensive than a regular burger, this version is oozing with flavor and well worth the extra effort–crunchy, tangy,<br> sweet, savory and juicy, all in one burger. The jalapeños aren't spicy because they are seeded, but if you want an extra kick,<br> leave the seeds in. Save time by making the sauce, slaw and patties ahead of time.</p>
